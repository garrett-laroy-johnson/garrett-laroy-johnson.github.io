I am running "Chaosmotic Systems: Chaos, Culture, and Cosmology" as the MFA graduate seminar in AT/SP at SAIC. I received a small grant to invite three guest discussants, including Brian Holmes. The conversations will be recorded and posted to my teaching website.

In November I will give a talk at the Society for Literature Science and the Arts with collaborator Kristin McWharter about our LARP: I WANT AN AI FOR PRESIDENT.

## before

### Summer 2024

I designed a new hardware interface for the eurorack format built around the Daisy Microcontroller platform. I am also convening a working group to develop this into a hardware software eco-system called CCAM: ESTUARY.

Kristin McWharter and I ran our LARP about institutional politics and automation called "I WANT AN AI FOR PRESIDENT" at Co-Prosperity Sphere in Bridgeport Chicago as part of their DEMOCRAZY programming.

I took a 7-week course in ComfyUI, a new open-source interface for Stable Diffusion based image generation with NYU professor Derrick Schultz.

I designed CCAM:EARTH, a hardware platform built around the audio-focused Daisy Microcontroller. CCAM designed software for the EARTH that allowed them to be patched together in the style of modular synths.

I organized and ran a workshop around CCAM EARTH at Watershed Art & Ecology in Pilsen, Chicago.

I invited and hosted conversations around technology the community-generating aspects of Chicago House Music at an event called FUTURHYTHMMACHINES with guests Dr. Thomas DeFrantz, Dr. Meida McNeal, and Duane Powell.

### Spring 2024

I presented about CCAM and gave a DIY synth workshop of my own design at the inaugural Electronics Faire at Temple University in Philadelphia.

I collaborated with Chicago's Onion City Film Festival on an experimental expanded cinema event called WE DON'T KNOW YET: what a cinema can do.

I partnered with SAIC's Performance Technology Research Group to host and mentor 3 groups in an international Synth Hackathon.
