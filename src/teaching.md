## TEACHING

Since 2019 I've taught art and technology studio courses as well as theory seminars at diverse institutions of higher education. I currently teach in the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Art and Technology / Sound Practices](https://www.saic.edu/atsp) department and at the University of Illinois Chicago's New Media Art division.

Previously I have taught at SUNY Purchase in the New Media Division and at the School of Arts, Media and Engineering at Arizona State University. I served as a TA for a wide range of courses from design, music history, to creative coding in graduate school.

My syllabi and course materials are (mostly) hosted online at [https://practices.digital](https://practices.digital). In 2020 my curriculum and pedagogy were distinguished with a Teaching Excellence Award from ASU. I also teach community workshops and courses.
