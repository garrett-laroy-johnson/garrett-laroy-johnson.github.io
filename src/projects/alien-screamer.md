I designed PCBs based on a schematic design by Ray Wilson. The intention of the workshop was to introduce beginners to DIY synth-making with hands on soldering and live performance at the end.

You can find the workshop materials [here](https://ccam.world/resources/alien-screamer/).

I ran this workshop at [Temple University's Electronics Faire](https://ccam.world/programs/24-04-26-alien-screamer-workshop-temple-philly/) in April 2024. The workshop is now part of CCAM's [Estuary group](https://ccam.world/projects/estuary/) repertoire, which means it now serves as a way for new teachers to learn how to teach these materials.
