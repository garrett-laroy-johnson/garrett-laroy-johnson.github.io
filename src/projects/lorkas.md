From 2013 to 2015, I directed the student-led Laptop Orchestra of Arizona State. We created DIY and nomadic immersive media environments for the performance of member-composed pieces. As a group of five-fifteen, we performed extensively around Phoenix, Flagstaff, and even received funding to fly to Ames, IOWA to perform at a meeting of A2RU. My last major project as director was producing our only album, NODES, which we released as a cassette.

Directing LORKAS was formative in my research interests; making music and performing together became a laboratory for asking questions about collaboration and coordination. It also revealed my interest in honing skills as a leader who could be responsive and supportive of a collective. Our access to university resources was a great and temporary privilege; I made great efforts to incorporate diverse practices and to make the group open to performers and composers in the Tempe and Phoenix experimental music scenes.

I learned to make use of resources available to me; as a student group we were able to invite important and influential guests to speak, give workshops, and collaborate with, including Mark Hosler of Negativland, computer musician Stephen David Beck, LA-based designer and noise musician John Wiese, and composer and Cycling 74 developed Tim Place.

In groups of 5-15, the 2014 Southwest Electronic Music Festival, the 2015 Southwest Maker Festival, the 2015 [Oh My Ears](https://www.ohmyears.org/) new music marathon, Glendale Community College's Experimental Music Festival 2015. We also performed on Phoenix's Fox 10 Saturday morning show, a very interesting experience.

My compositions for laptop orchestra were also performed at the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and in Athens, Ohio.
