Digital fabricator Matthew Briggs and I created "tripods" during a phase of my work that was concerned with creating nomadic performance environments. This came from a desire to bring "high-art" electronic mediated performances into DIY, everyday, and outdoor spaces.

This demanded the use of inexpensive materials that could even be returned to home depot after use. Three 8" dowels can quickly be lashed together into a tripod, then wrapped and zip-tied with bulbs controlled by MaxMSP via DMX dimmer boxes. I designed audio-responsive algorithms as well as other oscillating behaviors. We created three tripods deployed in Flagstaff, Iowa, and in venues across Arizona.
