SloMoCo was a durational event-experiment sponsored by the MOCO (Movement and Computing) steering committee and community which ran from March to December 2021. SloMoCo is refiguring the conference form via global collaborations in collective knowledge-production, cybernetically informed learning-making structurations, and telematically mediated field practice. SloMoCo temporally (explodes, augments, prolates) the event conference as a site of knowledge production.

SloMoCo hosted a total of over fifty groups and individuals of artists and 134 researchers. In the Spring, we were joined by twenty-five projects, nineteen in the Summer, and twelve in the Fall.

I designed and ran SloMoCo with a small-team of volunteer chairs, mostly graduate students. To encourage open access to a conference that usually costs more than $400 in conference registration alone, there was no cost to participate.
