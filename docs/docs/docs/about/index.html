<h1>about</h1>
<p>I'm currently on faculty at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the department of <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/art-and-technology-studies/">Art and Technology Studies</a>, where I <a href="http://www.practices.digital">teach art and technology practices and interactive art + creative code</a>. Next year, I'll introduce a course called Anxious Media Ecology: Anxiety and/as Technology of Resistance.</p>
<p>I work with responsive media environments to probe, condition, engender, and refract relations between technological determinations and productions of subjectivity. I design and create digital-physical systems activating sound, light, and expressive materials in immersive and quotidian spaces. My dissertation deals with the diagram (as instantiated in Guattari and Deleuze) as a conceptual figure for animating transdisciplinary practice with computational media. Through my own research-creation and digital-physical sciences, I explore how socially engaged media arts can engage with contemporary subjectivity.</p>
<p>I am based in Chicago, where I teach at the <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/art-and-technology-studies/">School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Art and Technology Studies</a> department. In December 2022 I received my PhD in <a href="https://artsmediaengineering.asu.edu/degree-programs/media-arts-and-sciences-phd">Media Arts and Sciences</a> and <a href="https://english.clas.asu.edu/degrees/grad/critical-theory-grad-certificate">Critical Theory (grad certificate)</a> at Arizona State University. I completed an MA in musicology from Arizona State University, a B.Music in Music History from Ohio University, and a DAAD award to study musicology at the University of Leipzig.</p>
<p>I have presented research at MOCO, ISEA, SEAMUS, SLSA and SLSAeu, ACLA, AAG, and has had works performed and exhibited at Kennedy Center as well as the National Academy of Sciences in DC, in London, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Irvine, and Phoenix. My work uses community organizing as a platform socially engaged arts research and design, exemplified in groups such as LORKAS (the laptop orchestra of arizona state, 2013-2015), PHuN (the post-human network, 2016-2020), and ITITIT{inc} (2017-2019). I'm currently chair of <a href="www.moco21.movementcomputing.org">SloMoCo</a>, a durational conference experiment hosted by <a href="movementcomputing.org">Movement and Computing</a>, a social design project about the transformative effects of the gathering event on research practice. In my dissertation, I developed an interviewing method to work with SloMoCo with participants in order to generate a new set of institutional organizational practices.</p>
<p>I have been active in different organizations while ASU. I am a graduate student affilitate of <a href="http://www.synthesiscenter.net">Synthesis@ASU</a>. I also worked as an experimental fellow at the <a href="https://centerforphilosophicaltechnologies.org">Center for Philosophical Technologies (2018-2019)</a>. In 2016 I co-founded <a href="http://www.post-human.net">Post-Human Network (PHuN)</a>, a grad-led critical theory interest group. As co-director of PHuN, I organized two symposiums and two conferences, and facilitated reading groups on campus and over video conferencing with an internatioanl group of interlocutors.</p>
<p>I create immersive responsive media environments + installations interactive dance works, various performances for live electronics, laptop orchestra pieces, and sound-based fixed media. I've worked and practiced as an improviser with experimental electronic performance, e.g. with the dark/ambient group <a href="https://wearegulch.bandcamp.com/">Gulch</a>, and with cello and laptop in the group gbjjck. My performative and installation works with live electronic has been featured to SEAMUS, the Oh My Ears! Music Marathon, Interference Series and the ACDA at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and his installations have been featured at the 2013 ASU Microtonal Music Festival, ARTEL PHX, and commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art for <a href="https://influxaz.com/installation/topo-by-briggs-johnson-and-kautz/">InFlux Cycle 6.</a></p>
<p>I led <a href="https://lorkas.bandcamp.com/album/nodes">LORKAS (The Laptop Orchestra of Arizona State)</a> from Fall 2013 to Spring 2015 as the group’s director. During his tenure, LORKAS performed at the A2RU national conference, the 2014 Southwest Electronic Music Festival, the 2015 Southwest Maker Festival, the 2015 Oh My Ears new music marathon, Glendale Community College's Experimental Music Festival 2015. During these years, I hosted an array of guests including Cycling 74 developer Tim Place, experimental musician John Wiese, and Mark Hosler of Negativland.</p>
<p>In 2015, I completed an MA in Musicology at Arizona State University, where he wrote <a href="https://repository.asu.edu/items/29971">a masters thesis</a> investigating the role of the body in David Rosenboom's exploratory use of electroencephalography in musical performance. During my masters, I presented some of his musicological investigations into the the bioregional music of experimental American composer David Dunn and the psycho-dramaturgy of Wolfgang Rihm’s opera Dionysos (2010) at various conferences in the US and Canada. I organized SSOO (something said only once), a four-day arts mini-fest in May of 2015 thematizing improvisation, algorithmic creation, indeterminacy, and site-specificity.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Music in Music History with a minor in German from Ohio University. The 2011 Deutsche Akademische Austausch Dienst (DAAD) undergraduate scholarship award supported my study and research at the University of Leipzig, where I also performed and toured with the Leipziger Universitaets Orchester, took courses at the Institut der Musikwissenschaft, was awarded the highest certification in the German language (DSH-3). For my Bachelors thesis, I investigated the music of Swiss composer-pianist Nik Bärtsch from the perspective of the Swiss jazz-classical scene. The research was supported by two months field work in Zurich and Bern.</p>
<p>Recreationally I enjoy cycling, bikepacking, and backpacking. Although my work is less strictly musical these days, I am always seeking out promising shows and concerts. I find relaxation in cooking, sci-fi lit &amp; tv, and table-top board games and video games.</p>
