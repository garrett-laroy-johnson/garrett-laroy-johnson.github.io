<p>“The richer rule over the poor and the borrower is slave to the lender.” (NIV, Proverbs 22:7)
Modern financial capitalism retains this ancient function of debt as a violent mechanism of
enslavement and exploitation (Marazzi, 2011; Lazzarato, 2011, 2015). Universal debt amnesty
stands among the battle cry of many anarcho-communist movements, but there may be no
forgetting; economic bondage may too be deeply entwined with the history of money (Graeber,
2011) or too deeply ingrained in our memory (Atwood, 2007) for insurrectionary tactics like the
propaganda of the deed. How might we, instead, transfigure debt into a collectively beneficial
institution? What are the tactics for reclaiming debt as a constructive force benefiting
communities rather than finance capital? What insights could empirical approaches to
research-creation yield?</p>
<p>Following the world-building spirit of Guattari’s Three Ecologies (1992), Kropotkin’s Mutual Aid
(1902), and Murray Bookchin’s social ecology (1982), I pursue this reclaimed notion of debt in
the design of an experimental and experiential immersive media environment called Mutual
Space. Mutual Space responds through floor projection, multi-channel sound, dynamic lighting
and other physical-digital assemblages to bodily gesture sensed using computer vision and
signal processing techniques. Bodies sensed by camera deform a fluid simulation (projected
onto the floor). Actions like moving, speaking, sitting, napping etc. in this environment effect
forces in the fluid system, which carries clusters of colored particles projections across the
floor. The fluid system and these particles act as a “prototypical” non-discretized ledger. For
example, if reading light is needed, we may gesture to push the illumination particles over the
reader. Our gestures in turn create new particles for other uses, like powering a cooling fan or
watering a plant. Without predefined actors, ensembles of fleshy bodies and media transact
and exchange continuously . Rebuking the quantization of value and debt as obligation, this
experimental work explores an embodied post-scarcity economics in which collectives are
strengthened by accumulation of heterogeneous mutual indebtedness.</p>
