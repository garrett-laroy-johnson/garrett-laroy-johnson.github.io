      <p>Cyberpunk and counterculture visions of the internet from early developers and visionaries such as Tim Berners-Lee, virtual-reality pioneer Mark Pesce, and speculative fiction authors such as William Gibson and Neal Stephenson propheted new social spaces and global enlightenment. Prototypical media ecologies such as SRI’s NLS, Pesce’s VRML, etc.  disrupted the centralized mass media hierarchy and yearned instead towards what thinker Felix Guattari called “post-media age in which the media will be reappropriated by a multitude of subject-groups.” While social media networks such as FaceBook and Twitter have become platforms for niche groups, social media by-and-large continues to effect an alienation of individuals.</p>

<p>Failing state protections against the commercialization of digital media spaces, the internet will become increasingly inaccessibile as a free commodity. How can we leverage the ubiquitousness of hardware microcomputers unleashed through the Internet of Things, the so-called Maker Movement, along with the sheer volume of information to bootstrap a different kind of technically mediated social space? One which is not optimized for (corporate profit through) data aggregation and surplus value extraction, but organized by the stakeholders themselves? Recent projects such as Ethereum’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) orbit tightly around questions of governance and consensus and propose interesting models for such spaces.

<p>This research and practice stream uses responsive media and social design to prototype new socio-informatics-- logics of organization and exchange that produce different economic relations.</p>
