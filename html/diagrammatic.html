<h4>XR system for diagrammatic thought</h4>

<h5>note: this project is a work-in-progress towards my dissertation. below you will find the motivation and a brief description of the system.</h5>
      <p>In the 1970s, French and Italian artists, activists, and psychoanalysts such as Felix Guattari experimented with pirate radio as social experiments and observing the emergence of new proto-web technologies such as Minitel. These informed Guattari description of a nascent “post-media era”, in which media would allow for the formation of subjective groups from the bottom up instead from top down (where broadcast mass media enacts a top-down subject formation). The promise of the post-media era was (is) how telecommunications and computational media infrastructure could be leveraged to support the formation of new group subjectivities. These subjectivities, in their view, would be crucial for articulating and enacting the social and economic organization of more equitable futures.</p>

<p>Today,telecommunication is ubiquitous and social media affords the formations of all kinds of groups. In our contemporary research and innovation economy, the fields of HCI and Media Arts and Sciences are uniquely positioned to leverage institutional capacity and digital technologies to create impact through policy and empower communities through platform creation. But have HCI and the media arts andsciences failed to attend to the importance of the psyche? The stakes are high. Social media has provento be a crucial amplifier for overdue justice movements from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter. Meanwhile, the proliferation of extractive techniques, dark patterns, and attentive optimizationnegatively impacts many users’ mental health, cybernetically perpetuating circuits of anxiety and depression. What’s more, social media may even encourage divisive forms of dissent, weakening individuals’ tolerance for collaboration and sabotaging the endurance political movements need to organize.</p>

<p>The want for structurally different alternatives motivates me to bring to bear what Guattari calls diagrammatics on creative computational media. Taken up in many different contexts, diagrammatics is the practice of creating improvised models of the world and, in turn, mapping subjectivity. Concatenating and conjugating diagrammatics and media, my research asks: How can we use technologies to create maps and diagrams of our contemporary subjectivity? What new collaborativemodes of writing does this enable? How can creative practice with responsive and sensor rich computational media make machines for fighting anxiety? How can the anxious subject use these practices to reconfigure their relationship to the social, and, by extension, to the future? How can newmodels of collective subjectivity generate more equitable institutional practices? In pursuit of these questions experimentally, experimentally, and empirically, I created an extended reality media system called diagrammatic. Atop a table or awall, projected media objects such as video, sound clips, images, and text intermingle with physical objects. A person associates a fiducial marker with a media object, allowing them to reassemble media objects in space on the fly. Looking to enable new forms of writing which take seriously how we invest emotionally into media objects and use them to make meaning, diagrammatic also allows for “bundling” of several media objects, enacting lateral connections a la Vannevar Bush or Marcel Proust.</p>

<p>These diagrams live as JSON files that can also be viewed and manipulated on a personal computerwith standard display. Apart from its embodied and material innovations, diagrammatic aspires togenerate new modes of collaborative writing. Instead of emphasizing the real-time synchronous collaboration which has become omnipresent during the pandemic, diagrammatic leverages strategies from deep work and governance structures from open-source software. Diagrams produced by diagrammatic are stored as GitHub repositories. Thus the collaborative authorship structure leveragesan effective tool that assumes very little about where, who, and when collaborators are while aff ordingcontributors authorship and decision making agency. Experimentation in digital-first publicationplatforms at independent and academic publishers alike signals a hunger for more accessible and expressive venues for writing.</p>
